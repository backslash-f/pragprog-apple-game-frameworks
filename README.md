# pragprog-apple-game-frameworks
Repo for the projects in the book "*Apple Game Frameworks and Technologies - Build 2D Games with SpriteKit &amp; Swift*" by **Tammy Coron**, [published by The Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/titles/tcswift/apple-game-frameworks-and-technologies/).

## Notes
Although the chapters in the book target only **iOS**, the projects in this repo target **macOS**, and **tvOS** too because why not. Let's see how that goes... ⚰️

Also the projects in here use `SwiftUI` and `Combine` whenever possible. They rely on [the new Apple's `SceneView` structure](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/sceneview) too. There is no `AppDelegate`, `ViewControllers` and/or `Storyboards`. We are living in the future. 🦾
