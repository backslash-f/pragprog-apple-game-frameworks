# pragprog-apple-game-frameworks
Repo for the projects in the book "*Apple Game Frameworks and Technologies - Build 2D Games with SpriteKit &amp; Swift*" by [**Tammy Coron**](https://tammycoron.com), [published by The Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/titles/tcswift/apple-game-frameworks-and-technologies/).

## Notes
- Although the chapters in the book target only **iOS**, the projects in this repo target **macOS** and **tvOS** too.
- The projects rely on [the new Apple's `SceneView` structure](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/sceneview). There is no `AppDelegate`, `ViewControllers` and/or `Storyboards`. We are living in the future. 🦾
- `SwiftUI` and `Combine` are used whenever possible.
- 🎮 Controller support via [Apple's Game Controller Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller) is added when possible.
- Tested on **Xcode 12.2 beta 4 (RC)** and **Swift 5.3.1**

## Requirements
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) (`brew install swiftlint`)
